## **Introduction**


The use of computer vision provides a very inexpensive way of detecting the speed of the cars while at the same time enables the system to monitor the car over speeding, making it easier and inexpensive to fine the offender as compared to the traditional method where the highway patrolling cars detect the over speeding cars and follow the particular car in order to fine it. In addition to this, the monitoring of flow of cars in and out of a certain region via counter, helps us to monitor and effectively predict the traffic flow situation in the city.
Here, relevant authorities can monitor the flow of cars and based on those readings, can recommend the commuters to adopt an alternative route, allowing the diversification of traffic flow and avoiding the traffic jams.

Common Techniques used for Object Detection are classical computer vision techniques and Deep learning approaches. In classical computer Vision, the background removal technique is used to detect object. The idea of background removal is not a modern one; instead, it has existed in the field since the dawn of modern technology. Hence, there have been numerous techniques for background removal in the domain of computer vision. Nevertheless, classical computer vision techniques are constantly being overthrown by modern, artificial intelligence-based ones by lodging more innovative ideas giving more precise and accurate results. In modern approaches toward object detection using Artificial Neural Network, objects can be detected by higher accuracy with respect to classical computer vision techniques. How ever we used both methods to detect object.
Using cross ratio invariant principle, along with the position of the two reference points, vanishing point of the image and the known real-world values, we can estimate the distance of the car and the marker in the real world. By using this change in distance from the subsequent
