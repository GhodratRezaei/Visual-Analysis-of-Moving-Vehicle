## **Introduction**

In any major traffic flow area ranging from highways/motorways to city centers, two main issues are the speed of the moving vehicles and the check on number of vehicles entering/exiting a certain area. Where high speed of the vehicles may lead to traffic accidents and loss of the life and property, on the other hand, unaccountable flow of vehicles in a certain area may lead to grid-lock traffic jams resulting in loss of valuable time and resources for the commuters.
The use of computer vision provides a very inexpensive way of detecting the speed of the cars while at the same time enables the system to monitor the car over speeding, making it easier and inexpensive to fine the offender as compared to the traditional method where the highway patrolling cars detect the over speeding cars and follow the particular car in order to fine it. In addition to this, the monitoring of flow of cars in and out of a certain region via counter, helps us to monitor and effectively predict the traffic flow situation in the city.
Here, relevant authorities can monitor the flow of cars and based on those readings, can recommend the commuters to adopt an alternative route, allowing the diversification of traffic flow and avoiding the traffic jams.
